Configuration
-----

Add to your gemfile

```ruby
gem 'omniship', git: 'git://github.com/wantable/omniship.git'
```

Set authentication details; you only need the details for services you'll be using; tracking url stuff doesn't need any authentications

```ruby
Omniship::UPS.username = 'johndoe'
Omniship::UPS.password = '1234567890'
Omniship::UPS.token = 'QWERTYUIOP'

Omniship::USPS.userid = 'johndoe'
Omniship::USPS.password = '1234567890'

Omniship::Landmark.username = 'johndoe'
Omniship::Landmark.password = '1234567890'
Omniship::Landmark.client_id = '123'
Omniship::Landmark.test_mode = true # this turns Landmark's test mode on

Omniship::DHLGM.username = 'johndoe'
Omniship::DHLGM.password = '1234567890'
Omniship::DHLGM.mailer_id = '1234567890' # this is required to detect the shipper type, since USPS and DHL are otherwise indistinguisiblle

Omniship.debug = true # with this enabled all xml request's and responses will be outputed to the log
```

You can also do this in a config file
config/settings.yaml

```yml
Omniship:
  debug: true
  
  USPS:
    userid: johndoe
    password: 1234567890
    client_ip: 127.0.0.1
    source_id: Wantable, Inc. 

    retailer:
      name: Wantable 
      address: 223 N Water St. STE 300
    permit:
      number: 1234
      city: Milwaukee
      state: WI
      zip5: 53202
    pdu:
      po_box: 223 N Water ST STE 300
      city: Milwaukee 
      state: WI 
      zip5: 53202

  UPS:
    username: johndoe
    password: 1234567890

  Landmark:
    username: johndoe
    password: 1234567890
    client_id: 123
    debug: true


  DHLGM:
    username: johndoe
    password: 1234567890
```


and then set it up in an intializer like: 

```ruby 
Omniship.config('config/settings.yml')
```

trk.class
# => Omniship::UPS::Track::Response

trk.shipment.class
# => Omniship::UPS::Track::Shipment

trk.shipment.packages.first.has_arrived?
# => true / false

```

Make a return shipping label

* In order to use this USPS api you need to first obtain "Merchandise Return Service Permit"; directions for that are [here](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/development-guide-v3-1c.pdf) in the section labeled "Obtain a Merchandise Return Service Permit"
* You can get a userid and password [here](http://www.usps.com/webtools/) but you need to call them at 1-800-344-7779 and have them activate it for the production server. The api doesn't seem to work with the test server at all; but they'll activate you no questions asked in like a 30 second phone call.


Additional config

```ruby
customer = {
    name: "Casey Juan Lopez", 
    address1: "223 N Water St.", 
    address2: "STE 300",

    state: "WI",
    zip5: "53202"
}
options = {
